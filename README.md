# FourBar

This program was created as a part of a final project for Linearity II at the Olin College of Engineering. The main function of this program is to simulate a Four Bar linkage, and allow the user to change and experiment with the properties of the four bar linkage to better understand how they work.

Additionally, to generate the initial Four Bar linkage, this program creates 200 linkages and chooses the one that makes the most similar drawing to the user drawing.

Features:

Simulates a Four Bar linkage

User can change every variable in the linkage through a simple UI

User can move the linkage, zoom in and out, and change the speed of the simulation

User can draw a curve and the first linkage will create a relatively similar shape.
